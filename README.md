# Sorting Visualizer

This is a small project where I learned more about Classes in C++ and played around with Raylib library.

It is a simple implementation of Buble Sort Algorithm.

To play around with my code you need:

- Raylib
- C++ 11 or higher

The build shell script is ment for Linux users, for Windows you can compile it by hand.
